From their ancient roots in the Terai region to their struggle for recognition in modern Nepal, the Tharu community has played an important role in the cultural and social fabric of the country. Despite facing challenges like land displacement, cultural marginalization, and political exclusion, the Tharus continue to assert their identity, rights, and cultural heritage in the modern political landscape of Nepal.</p>
